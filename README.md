# PROJECT TOL (Tree of Life) - Blog
A blog developed using PHP and MySQL. Created primarily for my younger sister for the purpose of allowing her to write daily journals.

Currently, the blog enables users to write public/private postings (w/ images attached) as well as log-in authentication, account creation, password reset via an emailed link following SMTP and many other cool features!

# Want to try it?
- Currently hosted under my father's domain: https://www.flyyanet.com/tol/

# Inspiration
- to explore more about back-end development while learning PHP and MySQL (it's my first project w/ real back-end)
- to provide my sister a place to write daily and hopefully look back at in the future

# Tech Stack
- PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS (Bootstrap)
- cPanel, phpMyAdmin

# Challenges/Cool Things I've learned!
- working with PHP and MySQL was a steep learning curve
- creating an effective/efficient relational database to manage posts/comments/accounts/etc.
- securely authenticating users and storing their authentication details
